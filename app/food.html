      <h1 class="food-main-title">Jamaican Food</h1>
      <p class="food-txt">Jamaican cuisine includes a mixture of cooking techniques, flavours, spices and influences from the indigenous people on the island of Jamaica, and the Spanish, British, Africans, Indian and Chinese who have inhabited the island. It is also influenced by the crops introduced into the island from tropical Southeast Asia. Jamaican cuisine includes various dishes from the different cultures brought to the island with the arrival of people from elsewhere. Other dishes are novel or a fusion of techniques and traditions. In addition to ingredients that are native to Jamaica, many foods have been introduced and are now grown locally. A wide variety of seafood, tropical fruits and meats are available.

      Some Jamaican cuisine dishes are variations on the cuisines and cooking styles brought to the island from elsewhere. These are often modified to incorporate local produce. Others are novel and have developed locally. Popular Jamaican dishes include curry goat, fried dumplings, ackee and saltfish (cod) – the national dish of Jamaica – fried plantain, "jerk", steamed cabbage and "rice and peas" (pigeon peas or kidney beans). Jamaican cuisine has been adapted by African, Indian, British, French, Spanish, Chinese influences. Jamaican patties and various pastries and breads are also popular as well as fruit beverages and Jamaican rum.

      Jamaican cuisine has spread with emigrations, especially during the 20th century, from the island to other nations as Jamaicans have sought economic opportunities in other areas.</p>

            <p class="food-head">Ackee and Saltfish</p>
            <p class="food-in-txt">The ackee fruit was imported to The Caribbean from Ghana before 1725, as Ackee or Aki is another name for the Akan tribe, Akyem. It is also known as Blighia sapida. The scientific name honours Captain William Bligh who took the fruit from Jamaica to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England in 1793 and introduced it to science. Because parts of the fruit are toxic, there are shipping restrictions when being imported to countries such as the United States.

            To prepare the dish, salt cod (salt fish should be soaked overnight to eliminate most of the salt) is sautéed with boiled ackee, onions, Scotch Bonnet peppers (optional), tomatoes, and spices, such as black pepper and pimiento.</p>

            <p class="food-head">Callaloo</p>
            <p class="food-in-txt">Callaloo (sometimes calaloo or kallaloo) is a popular Caribbean dish originating in West Africa served in different variants across the Caribbean. The main ingredient is a leaf vegetable, traditionally either amaranth (known by many local names, including callaloo or bhaaji), taro or xanthosoma. Both are known by many names, including callaloo, coco, tannia, bhaaji, or dasheen bush. Because the leaf vegetable used in some regions may be locally called "callaloo" or "callaloo bush", some confusion can arise among the vegetables and with the dish itself. Outside of the Caribbean, water spinach is occasionally used.</p>

            <p class="food-in-txt">Breadfruit was brought to Jamaica by British Seaman, Captain Bligh, who traveled aboard the HMS Providence in 1793. It was brought from the Pacific region (Tahiti).

            It is said tha the first tree was planted in the Bath Botanical Gardens here on the island and after a while more trees were planted in other parishes parishes. It was used primarily as food for the slave population.</p>

            <p class="food-head">Cornedbeef and Rice</p>
            <p class="food-in-txt">This dish became popular in Jamaica due to its versatility and long shelf-life. Jamaicans are often subjected to harsh island weather such as hurricanes. In situations like these, many residents of Jamaica rely on canned food that isn’t perishable. Tinned corned beef, or “bully beef,” has been a popular option in such situations. This is because it is delicious, filling, and one can prepare it in many different ways. You can even eat it straight from the can during power-outages.

            For all of these reasons, cans of corned beef became a staple food for both British and American soldiers. It quickly grew in popularity, and with the rise of Jamaican restaurants in the United States, many Americans are now enjoying this versatile and culturally-rich dish. The corned beef recipe below will allow you to partake in this little bit of history as well.</p>

            <p class="food-head">Beef Patty</p>
            <p class="food-in-txt">A Jamaican patty is a pastry that contains various fillings and spices baked inside a flaky shell, often tinted golden yellow with an egg yolk mixture or turmeric. It is made like a turnover but is more savoury. As its name suggests, it is commonly found in Jamaica, and is also eaten in other areas of the Caribbean, such as the Caribbean coast Nicaragua and Costa Rica. It is traditionally filled with seasoned ground beef, but fillings can include chicken, pork, lamb, vegetables, shrimp, lobster, fish, soy, ackee, mixed vegetables or cheese. In Jamaica, the patty is often eaten as a full meal, especially when paired with coco bread. It can also be made as bite-sized portions called cocktail patties. Among the Jamaican diaspora in the UK, the pastry is more like that of a suet crust, and often made with the fat from curry goat which provides the yellow color.</p>

            <p class="food-in-txt">Festival is street food at it’s best and traditionally eaten on the beach alongside Escovitch Fish or the like. If you’ve never had it, it’s basically a fried cornbread fritter or dumpling. Unlike traditional Jamaican Fried Dumplings, Festival is sweet, crisp on the outside and dense. Most earlier recipes were very heavy with equal amounts of flour and cornmeal. But nowadays you’ll often find ones with just a hint of cornmeal.</p>

            <p class="food-head">Oxtail</p>
            <p class="food-in-txt">Oxtail (occasionally spelled ox tail or ox-tail) is the culinary name for the tail of cattle. Formerly, it referred only to the tail of an ox or steer, a bullock (a castrated male).

            Oxtail is a bony, gelatin-rich meat, which is usually slow-cooked as a stew or braised. It is a traditional stock base for a soup. Although traditional preparations often involve hours of slow cooking, modern methods usually take a shortcut by utilizing a pressure cooker. 

            Stewed oxtail with butter beans or as main dish (with rice) is popular in Jamaica, Trinidad, and other West Indian cultures.

            <p class="food-head">Rice and Peas</p>
            <p class="food-in-txt">Rice and peas is the mainstay of the cuisines of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and many other English-speaking Caribbean islands. Rice and peas is traditionally, but not exclusively, eaten with the Sunday meal. The dish is made with rice and any available legume, such as kidney beans, pigeon peas (known as gungo peas), or cowpeas, the combination of grain and a legume forming a complete protein. Gungo peas are particularly associated with Christmas. The peas are boiled with pimento seeds (allspice) and garlic until tender. Salt, pepper, scotch bonnet, thyme, onion (usually spring onion), grated ginger and coconut milk are then added along with the rice and left to simmer until cooked.

            The Jamaican version of this dish derived from the Akan cuisine Waakye and is made in a similar way except without Millet leaves, baking soda and stews. There is no pepper nor thyme (as Thyme was introduced by the British in Jamaica) in Waakye, but can be added to your liking with either dish. Pepper is preferred in the Jamaican version.</p>

            <p class="food-head">Curry Goat</p>
            <p class="food-in-txt">Curry goat is a curry dish originating in South Asia and has become very popular in Indo-Caribbean cuisine. This dish has spread throughout the English speaking Caribbean and also the Caribbean diaspora in North America and Great Britain.

            Curry goat is a popular party dish in Jamaica, and at a "big dance" a local expert or "specialist" is often brought in to cook it. It is considerably more mild than the equivalent dishes from the Indian subcontinent and is flavoured with a spice mix that is typical of Indo-Jamaican cooking and Scotch Bonnet Peppers; it is almost always served with rice, dal bhat, or roti and, in restaurants in North America and Europe, other typically Caribbean side dishes such as fried plantain may be served as an accompaniment. There are many variations on the dish that include using mutton when goat is not available or bulking it out with potatoes.</p>
